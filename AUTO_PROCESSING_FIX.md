# Auto-Processing Fix

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Problem

The queue was stuck because files were uploaded but never processed. The frontend was polling `/api/queue` repeatedly but nothing was happening.

## Root Cause

The upload endpoint (`POST /api/upload`) was adding files to the queue but **NOT** automatically starting the processing. A separate manual call to `POST /api/process-queue` was required.

## Solution

### 1. **Auto-Start Processing After Upload**

Modified the upload endpoint to automatically trigger `processQueue()` after files are successfully added:

```javascript
// After successful upload...
res.json(response);

// Auto-start processing if files were added and queue is not already processing
if (validatedFiles.length > 0 && !isProcessing) {
  console.log("🚀 Auto-starting queue processing...");
  processQueue().catch((err) => {
    console.error("❌ Error auto-starting queue:", err.message);
  });
}
```

### 2. **Changed Frontend Dev Server Port**

Changed from port `5174` to `3050` (in the 3000 range):

**frontend/vite.config.js:**

```javascript
server: {
  port: 3050,  // Changed from 5174
  proxy: {
    '/api': {
      target: 'http://localhost:3001',
      changeOrigin: true,
      secure: false,
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Upload Flow (Automatic Processing):

```
1. User uploads files via frontend
   ↓
2. POST /api/upload receives files
   ↓
3. Files validated and added to queue
   ↓
4. Response sent to frontend
   ↓
5. processQueue() automatically called
   ↓
6. Files processed one by one
   ↓
7. Results available for download
```

### Manual Processing (Still Available):

```
POST /api/process-queue
```

Can still be used to manually trigger processing if needed.

## Server Configuration

- **Backend**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Frontend Dev**: `http://localhost:3050` ✅
- **API Proxy**: Frontend proxies `/api/*` to backend

## Testing

1. **Start Backend:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start Frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Access App:**
   - Open browser: `http://localhost:3050`
   - Upload a markdown file
   - Watch it automatically process! 🎉

## What You'll See

### Backend Logs:

```
🔥 /api/upload hit - Files: 1
  📄 Validating: example.md (5432 bytes)
  ✅ Added to queue: example.md
✅ Upload complete: 1 files added, 0 errors
🚀 Auto-starting queue processing...
🚀 Starting queue processing (1 files)

📄 Starting to process: example.md
🤖 Processing example.md with comprehensive conversion...
   Doc ID: doc_1728123456789_ABC123
   Content length: 5432 characters
✓ LLM processing complete
✅ Completed example.md - 15 chunks in 3245ms

🏁 Queue processing complete
```

### Frontend:

- Upload interface at `http://localhost:3050`
- Files automatically start processing after upload
- Queue status updates in real-time
- Download button appears when complete

## Benefits

✅ **No manual processing trigger needed** - Just upload and go!
✅ **Better UX** - Automatic processing means no extra clicks
✅ **Port in 3000 range** - Port 3050 as requested
✅ **Still supports manual trigger** - `/api/process-queue` endpoint remains available
✅ **Error handling** - Processing errors caught and logged

## Troubleshooting

If files don't auto-process:

1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify `isProcessing` flag isn't stuck (use `/api/queue` to check)
3. Use debug endpoint: `POST /api/debug/reset-processing`
4. Manually trigger: `POST /api/process-queue`

## Notes

- The `isProcessing` flag prevents multiple simultaneous processing runs
- Each file still has the 4-second cooldown delay between processing
- Frontend polls `/api/queue` every ~1 second to update UI
- CSP warning about Rokt is from Console Ninja extension (safe to ignore)
